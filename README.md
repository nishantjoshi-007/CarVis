## Requirements
### Task 1: Dataset Description
- In this task, you will select a dataset for your project. It can either be personally generated, stemming from a school project or personal interest, or sourced from online repositories. If opting for an online dataset, it is essential that it contains a minimum of 8 variables and 1000 records to ensure a robust analysis. In a concise paragraph, explain key details about your chosen dataset.

### Task 2: User Identification
- Moving on to Task 2, the focus is on identifying the user base for the analysis tool. Envision 2-3 distinct users with diverse interests and construct a user scenario for each. Each scenario should encompass details like background information (who they are), motivation (their goals) and tasks (what they want to do). 

### Task 3: Task Identification
- Task 3 entails identifying the specific tasks that users would want to perform while exploring the dataset. Narratively describe these tasks, crafting scenarios for each user identified in the preceding step. For example, "User A aims to uncover patterns in educational attainment influenced by socio-economic factors across various regions." Your dashboard will eventually aid in performing these tasks.

### Task 4: Data and Task Abstraction
- This task involves the application of data and task abstraction techniques. Articulate the methodologies you will employ to transform data and user tasks from the user space to the visualization design space. Elaborate on the abstraction processes and techniques, ensuring a thorough explanation with justification of the use of specific marks and channels for the information encoding.

### Task 5: Demo
- Write a use case scenario that demonstrates how the dashboard functions. Choose one of the users from task 2 as an example and create a 5-minute video tutorial illustrating how the user can navigate the data using the dashboard to accomplish their task.

### Technical Requirements:
- Your project should include a minimum of four interactive charts, utilizing at least two distinct types of interactive components selected from the following options: Dropdown, Input, Checklist, RadioItems, and Slider. You may also consider incorporating any other interactive elements you find suitable. While this is the basic requirement, you are encouraged to further enhance your project by integrating more interactive features.

### Submission Guidelines:
- Write a 2-4 page report that provides a summary of your project. On the first page, include only two links: the first link should lead to a 5-minute video presentation uploaded on Google Drive, and the second link should direct to your application hosted online.
- To understand the format of the report, consider reviewing the following paper:
